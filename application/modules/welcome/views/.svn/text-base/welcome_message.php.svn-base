<h2>Welcome to CodeIgniter</h2>

<p>CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP.
Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code
from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and
logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by
minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.</p>
